# Lab 2.1: Install Puppet Bolt

In this lab you will learn how to:

* Install the open source Bolt utility on Windows machines.
* Execute a simple command to validate that Bolt is working.

# Setup

You will need three machines:

* Two classroom-provided machines (one Windows, one Linux) to install Bolt onto. These are the **target machines**.
* A Windows or Linux machine that you will use to connect to the target machines. This is the **host machine**.

# Steps

### Installing Bolt onto a **Windows** target machine

#### Connect to the Windows target machine with RDP

**_You can get the details of which student machines you can use as target machines in the welcome page, located at https://classXXXX.classroom.puppet.com (replace XXXX with your classâ€™s numbers)._**

* If you are connecting to the Windows target machine from a **Windows** host machine, use Remote Desktop Connection.
 
* If you are connecting to the Windows target machine from a **macOS** host machine, use Microsoft Remote Desktop 10.

Connect with the following information:

* **hostname:** *XXXXwinY.classroom.puppet.com* (replace XXXX and Y with the correct numbers)
* **username:** *Administrator*
* **password:** *\<PASSWORD FROM THE WELCOME PAGE>*

#### Install Bolt on the Windows target machine

**_You will install Bolt on Windows using a third-party package manager,_** **chocolatey** **_._**

On the target machine, start a PowerShell session and run:

```PS C:\Users\Administrator> choco install puppet-bolt```

When prompted by the browser, click **Run**. Follow the installation wizard; no customization is required. Just **Accept the license**, click **Next** through the option windows, click **Install**, and finally **Finish**.

#### Validate the installation

Close any open PowerShell windows. **This is critical** in order for PowerShell to pick up the changes you just made with chocolatey.

Note that your version might be slightly different.

```
   PS C:\Users\Administrator> bolt --version
   1.17.0
```

Open a new PowerShell window and run:

```PS C:\Users\Administrator> bolt --version```

#### Run Bolt

```PS C:\Users\Administrator> bolt help```

or simply:

```PS C:\Users\Administrator> bolt```

This provides a page of helpful information for running Bolt. We will come back to Bolt after setting up the rest of the lab.
